\subsection*{Course Overview}
Software plays a critical role in almost all medical devices, spanning device control, feedback and algorithmic processing.  This course focuses on software design skills that are ubiquitous in the medical device industry, including software version control, unit testing, fault tolerance, integration testing and documentation.  Experience will be gained in both dynamically- (Python) and statically-typed (C/C++) languages.  Efficient programming practices for low computational resource devices will be covered.

The course will be structured around several small projects working with biosignals to develop software design fundamentals.  The course will culminate in a larger project working with clinical/research data and/or designing software for a small, embedded device.  Students will be expected to work in small groups.

Prerequisites: Introductory Programming Class (e.g., EGR103)

\subsection*{Fall Semester Class Schedule} 
All class activities will be officially listed in the class Sakai site
calendar.  Specific lecture details, along with deliverable due dates,
will be posted on this calendar, and new due dates will be announced in lecture
and by Sakai announcements that will be emailed to the class.  The following is
a summary of activities this semester (subject to change):

\input{schedule}

\subsection*{Attendance}
Lecture attendance and participation count for 10\% of
your class grade.  It is very understandable that students will have to miss
class for job interviews, personal reasons, illness, etc.  Absences will
be considered \emph{excused} if they are communicated to Dr. Palmeri at least
48 hours in advance or through submission of
\href{http://www.pratt.duke.edu/undergrad/policies/3531}{Short Term Illness
    Form (STIF)} {\bf before} class or lab.  Unexcused absences will count
against the attendance and participation component of your class grade.  

\subsection*{Textbooks \& References} 
There are no required textbooks for this class.  A variety of online resources will be referenced throughout the semester.

\subsection*{Distributed Version Control Software (git)} 
Software management is a ubiquitous tool in any engineering
project, and this task becomes increasingly difficult during group development.
Version control software has many benefits and uses in software development,
including preservation of versions during the development process, the ability
for multiple contributors and reviewers on a project, the ability to tag
``releases'' of code, and the ability to branch code into different functional
branches.  We will be using GitLab (\url{https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu}) to
centrally host our git repositories. Some guidelines for using your git repositories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{All} software additions, modifications, bug-fixes, etc.\ need
        to be done in your repository.
    \item The ``Issues'' feature of your repository should be used as a ``to
        do'' list of software-related items, including feature enhancements,
        and bugs that are discovered.
    \item There are several management models that we will review in class,
        with the major distinctions being individual user forks of the master
        repository, or a single mutli-write-user repository.  We will review
        these different management models in class, after which your group
        should choose one and stick with it.
    \item Dr. Palmeri will only review code that is committed to your master
        repository or your personal fork of that repository.  
    \item All of the commits associated with your repository are logged with
        your name and a timestamp, and these cannot be modified.  Use
        descriptive commit messages so that your group members, Dr. Palmeri,
        and Brenton can figure out what you have done!!  You should not
        need to email group members when you have performed a commit; your
        commit message(s) should speak for themselves.
    \item Code milestones should be properly tagged.
    \item Write software testing routines early in the development process so
        that anyone in your group or an outsider reviewing your code can be
        convinced that it is working as intended.
    \item Comment, comment, comment.
    \item Modular, modular, modular.
    \item Make commits small and logical; do them often!
\end{itemize}

We will review working with git repositories in lecture, and feedback
on your software repository will be provided on a regular basis.

\subsection*{Project Details} 
Project details will be discussed in lecture later in the semester.

\subsection*{Grading} 
The following grading scheme is subject to change as the semester progresses:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Attendance \& Participation             & 10\% \\
Coding projects                         & 60\% \\
Final Project                           & 30\% \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Duke Community Standard \& Academic Honor} Engineering is
inherently a collaborative field, and in this class, you are encouraged to work
collaboratively on your projects.  The work that you submit must be the product
of your and your group's effort and understanding.  All resources developed by
another person or company, and used in your project, must be properly
recognized.
 
All students are expected to adhere to all principles of the
\href{http://www.integrity.duke.edu/standard.html}{Duke Community Standard}.
Violations of the Duke Community Standard will be referred immediately to the
Office of Student Conduct.  Please do not hesitate to talk with Dr.\ Palmeri
about any situations involving academic honor, especially if it is ambiguous
what should be done.
