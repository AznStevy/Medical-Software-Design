# Introduction to Web Service Design

This lecture has some accompanying slides that can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sCWA78KixOqvwXuSoF2QAtZ8LAMRAxv0pU8B-9kVDd8/edit?usp=sharing). This lecture will introduce and cover:
* Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs)
* RESTful APIs
* Common HTTP requests: GET, POST, PUT, DEL
* Calling existing RESTful APIs from python (specifically http://adpl.suyash.io, Twilio, and a class API). 

Example code for a python program queries the ADPL API can be found in [call_apis](call_apis/).

## Minimal example
In python, we'll be using the `requests` library to call RESTful APIs that existing web services expose. Next lecture, we'll write our own web service that exposes functionality. See the associated jupyter notebook for an introduction to the requests library syntax.
