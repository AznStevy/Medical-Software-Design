# Installation Needs for ReactJS

* Install Node.JS (which comes with `npm`--the node package manager): https://nodejs.org/en/
* Install the `create-react-app` scaffolding tool:
  ```
  npm install -g create-react-app
  ```
* Go ahead and create a sample project called `react-learning` using `create-react-app` as follows:
  ```
  create-react-app react-learning
  ```
  This will create and initialize a react application in a new folder called `react-learning` in your current working directory. 
  
  ## Run a ReactJS Project
  When in the root of your project, simply run `npm run start` which will compile your application and open it in a browser.
  
  ## Install Dependencies after Cloning
  After cloning a new react project to your computer (say from a partner) that you haven't used before, you will have to install project dependencies (just like you did previously in a virtual environment). Run `npm install` from the root of the directory to install all project dependencies. After this is complete, you can run your project.
