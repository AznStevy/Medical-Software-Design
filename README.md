# Medical Software Design 

This repository serves as the default collection for all resources associated
with the Duke BME Medical Software Design course (BME547).

Your can consult the [Syllabus](syllabus.md) for an overview of the course
content, and the course [Schedule](schedule.md) to see what the progression of
course topics will be over the semester.  All [Lecture](Lecture/) content is
also available for review, as are all of the [Assignments](Assignments/), which
will have due dates appears on the course Sakai site.  General
[Resources](Resources/) are also available to help with using various software
packages, setting up development tools, etc.


## Local System Configuration
### Git
We will interface with git using CLI tools, not GUI-based tools and
integrations into your IDE.

### Python
While all of the software development practices covered in this class are meant
to be programming language agnostic, Python is used as the "default" language
for many of our tasks.  

*All code has been written to be compatible with Python >=3.5; Python 2.7 usage
will require some tweaking, specifically the `print()` function calls and fancy
string formatting.*

A generic python virtual environment can be created using the included
[requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file, which should provide package
coverage for all of the examples and Jupyter notebooks in this repository.  

### ReactJS
Web frontend development will be done using the [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
framework.

### Coding Environments & Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
You will see Dr. Palmeri doing most in-class exercises using
[VIM](http://www.vim.org).  This is a great and powerful editor for terminal
usage, but it does have an appreciable learning curve.

Some nice editors that have a huge community developing programming plugins
include:
* [GitHub Atom](https://atom.io)
* [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

JetBrains offers free use of their IDEs for education purposes.  We recommend:
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): Python projects 
* [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/): Javascript projects

You can also consider using [Microsoft Visual Studio
Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) that is also free
for usage.

As [JupyerLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) evolves,
we will start to incorporate it into more of the exercises.
