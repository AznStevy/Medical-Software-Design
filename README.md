# Medical Software Design 

This repository serves as the default collection for all resources associated
with the Duke BME Medical Software Design course (BME590).

Your can consult the [Syllabus](syllabus.md) for an overview of the course
content, and the course [Schedule](schedule.md) to see what the progression of
course topics will be over the semester.  All [Lecture](Lecture/) content is
also available for review, as are all of the [Assignments](Assignments/), which
will have due dates appears on the course Sakai site.

A generic python virtual environment can be created using the included
`requirements.txt` file, which should provide package coverage for all of the
examples and Jupyter notebooks in this repository.  

*All code has been written to be compatible with Python 3; Python 2.7 usage
will require some tweaking, specifically the `print()` function calls and fancy
string formatting.*
