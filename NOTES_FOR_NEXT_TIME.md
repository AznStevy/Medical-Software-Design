  + Consistent function names, etc.
  + Pre-existing tests / test data
  + Define minimum expected unit tests

* Have student repos in group, hopefully allowing specific runner to be student-enabled
* Four Types of Software Testing: http://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/4-types-software-testing-use-01704964#DEr51MdDRpj4zXyg.97

* more on SWIG / Cython
* multithread
* pandas
* setup.py
