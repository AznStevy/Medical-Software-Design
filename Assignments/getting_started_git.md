# Getting Started with git
This assignment will run you through the basics of git. 

You can start this assignment by visiting the following URL when logged into
your GitHub account: https://classroom.github.com/a/AAa4AZ7o

It will ask you to select your Duke email from a roster: be sure to select your
actual email (not doing so may be considered academic dishonesty). 

After, it will create a repository for your work that should include the
instructions for the assignment in the README. Let the instructors know if you
have any questions via the Co-Lab `#git` Slack channel. The repository that is
created will be just for you and your work.
